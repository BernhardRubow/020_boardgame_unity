# How to play
Use alpha0 to alpha4 to roll the dice for a particular player:

* **1** for **red** player
* **2** for **black** player
* **3** for **yellow** player
* **4** for **green** player

If the player is allowed to make a move, a simple UI at the top of the screen will appear. This UI will contain buttons for each available move the player can choose to make. *(description of the moves not implemented yet)*

Please press the button according to the move you have selected. This will trigger to move the selected player figure on the virtual gameboard (store in the gamelogic) and also of the visual representation of the player figure.
